Synca
=====

# Description
The code shows how to use coroutines to use asynchronous code in synchronous manner. It significanlty simplifies the logic and allows to concentrate on the task itself with performance degradation. So it includes the advantages of both asynchronous and synchronous approaches:
1. Advantage from asynchronous: performance.
2. Advantage from synchronous: simplicity.

The name 'synca' was taken using the following conversion: a+sync -> sync+a.
